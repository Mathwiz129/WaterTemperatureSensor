            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                This project is designed to monitor and record water temperatures in the Tennessee River, providing valuable information for open water swimmers, fishers, researchers, and anyone else who needs it. By offering real-time temperature readings, we aim to support recreational activities, inform scientific studies, and generally help people make the most of their time on the water. This project is all about gaining a better understanding of our river and benefiting everyone who enjoys its resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an open-source project, with most files (and this website hosted) available in this <a href="https://github.com/Mathwiz129/WaterTemperatureSensor" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W to continuously collect water temperature data from the Tennessee River, recording measurements every 15 seconds. This data is then transmitted to a remote server, allowing anyone to access it. To ensure accessibility and user-friendliness, we have developed this website to compile and present the collected data in real-time.
